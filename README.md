# Higher_lower

*Oh, restless soul in search of digital glory,  
Hear now a tale not of curriculum’s march,  
But of one coder’s quest—by leisure, not decree—  
To build a game where numbers rise and arch.*

## The Genesis of the Guess

> In times of respite from arduous school campaigns  
> Was born this project—neither mandated nor scored.  
> Not for 42’s laurels, nor for mentors’ applause,  
> But for the pleasure of play and code explored.

Welcome, O traveler, to **Higher or lower**—  
A guessing game of numbers, simple in its core,  
Where up or down, by wit or luck,  
You chase the secret digit evermore.

- The program picks a number, shrouded from your sight.
- You, the challenger, must guess: will the next be less, or more?
- With each guess, destiny responds: “Wrong!”, or “Right!”
- Play on, and let the fates reveal your score.

## Gameplay

> “O mortal! Guess now if the number ascends or falls—  
> And may fortune’s winds be ever at your back.”

1. The game will prompt you with a starting number.
2. You must predict if the next will be higher (`h`) or lower (`l`).
3. Each guess brings new chances for glory or defeat.
4. Dare to play again, or rest content with your legend.

## Acknowledgments

*Though no master nor curriculum gave this quest,  
I raise my thanks to muses, coders, and all who test.*

> “May your guesses be shrewd, your fun unending—  
> For this code was forged in freedom, by passion’s hand defending.”
