# Higher or lower

*Oh, restless voyager on digital seas,  
Pause here and heed a tale of chance and code—  
For not in classrooms bound, nor by masters’ decree,  
But by the hand of freedom was this game bestowed.*

## The Genesis of the Guess

> In times of respite from arduous school campaigns  
> Was born this project—neither mandated nor scored.  
> Not for 42’s laurels, nor for mentors’ applause,  
> But for the pleasure of play and code explored.

Welcome, O traveler, to **Higher or lower**—  
A guessing game of numbers, simple in its core,  
Where up or down, by wit or luck,  
You chase the secret digit evermore.
